# Sonic-Bloom

Arduino code for a functional payload module to be integrated within a solid engine rocket. The module will use a photoresistor as a sensor and use stepper motors as actuators to complete the dispersal of seeds local to the launch environment. The intention is to promote an environmental sustainability mission while encouraging biodiversity within the local flora systems of the launch environment.
